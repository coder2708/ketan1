    The Golden Temple, known as the Harmandir in India, was built in 1604 by Guru Arjun. It was destroyed several times by Afghan invaders and rebuilt in the early 19th century in marble and copper overlaid with gold foil. The temple occupies a small island in the center of a pool.The exquisite Golden Temple is a unique blend of the Hindu as well as the Islamic architecture. The shrine is decorated with marble sculptures and paintings that look similar to the Taj Mahal. The dome at the top is made from pure gold and the gurudwara is also encased with intricate gold panels.

    The total height of the structure is 240 m (790 ft), with a base of 58 m (190 ft) and the statue of 182 m (597 ft). The height of 182 was specifically chosen to match the number of seats in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. The statue is divided into five zones of which only three are accessible to the public.
